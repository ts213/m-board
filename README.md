An imageboard with the usual set of features and support for real time user boards creation/moderation and post deletion/editing.  
Uses Django REST backend server and lightweight React single page frontend.  

While fully anonymous when browsing, a user gets assigned a random ID after first post or board creation, which is then stored on both server and in the user's browser storage.  
That ID allows to authenticate the user's request when deleting or editing posts, and also when moderating a user created board.  

**Currently in development.**
